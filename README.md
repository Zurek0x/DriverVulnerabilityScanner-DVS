# DriverVulnerabilityScanner-DVS
Vulnerability scanner for windows specific drivers.

Scans drivers installed under system32 for exploitable permissions say for Byte Patching or ShellCode Injection.
If your fighting against a Anti-Virus or Anti-Cheat for other purposes remember to clear traces under Registry and SysCache.

Also clear bytecache under explorer and System.
